question,answer
What is machine learning?,"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed."
How does supervised learning work?,"Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, then makes predictions on new, unseen data."
What is the difference between classification and regression?,"Classification predicts discrete categories or classes, while regression predicts continuous numerical values."
What is overfitting in machine learning?,"Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new data."
What is cross-validation?,"Cross-validation is a technique to assess how well a model generalizes by training on different subsets of data and testing on the remaining data."
What is feature engineering?,"Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, or creating new features from raw data to improve model performance."
What is a neural network?,"A neural network is a computing system inspired by biological neural networks, consisting of interconnected nodes that process information."
What is deep learning?,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data."
What is the bias-variance tradeoff?,"The bias-variance tradeoff is the balance between a model's ability to fit training data (low bias) and generalize to new data (low variance)."
What is gradient descent?,"Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize the cost function."
What is a confusion matrix?,"A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate classification model performance by showing true vs predicted classifications."
What is precision and recall?,"Precision measures accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability to find all positive instances."
What is the F1 score?,"The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance."
What is regularization?,"Regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function."
What is ensemble learning?,"Ensemble learning combines multiple models to make better predictions than any individual model alone."
What is clustering?,"Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together without predefined labels."
What is dimensionality reduction?,"Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of input features while preserving important information."
What is a decision tree?,"A decision tree is a model that makes decisions by asking a series of yes/no questions about the input features."
What is random forest?,"Random forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting."
What is support vector machine?,"SVM is a classification algorithm that finds the best boundary to separate different classes of data."
