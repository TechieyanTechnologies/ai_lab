# ✅ Task 2 - Summary Statistics - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Overview
Task 2 is now fully interactive with dataset selection and creative activities that teach all statistical concepts through hands-on practice with visualizations.

## 🎨 What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Dataset Selection** ✅
- Students can select from 4 sample datasets
- Same loading mechanism as Task 1
- Works seamlessly across tasks
- Auto-loads if dataset already loaded

### 2. **Statistical Concepts Visual Guide** ✅
6 interactive concept cards that students can click to learn:
- **Mean (Average)** - Balance of data
- **Median (Middle)** - Center value
- **Mode (Most Common)** - Frequent value
- **Standard Deviation** - Spread measurement
- **Range** - Min to max span
- **Quartiles** - Distribution dividers

Each concept shows:
- Formula explanation
- Example calculations
- When to use it
- Visual descriptions

### 3. **Interactive Activities** ✅
4 different activities for hands-on learning:

#### 📊 Compute All Statistics
- Calculates mean, median, std dev, range
- Shows for all columns in dataset
- Displays in organized table

#### 📈 Visualize Distributions
- Create histogram charts
- Click any column to see its distribution
- Learn through visual representation

#### ❓ Statistics Quiz
- 3 questions about statistical concepts
- Tests understanding of:
  - Mean vs Median
  - When to use median
  - Standard deviation meaning
- Instant feedback with scores

#### 📊 Compare Columns
- Side-by-side comparison
- Calculate statistics for multiple columns
- See differences in means, medians, ranges
- Learn comparative analysis
